- Hypothesis Test Outcome:
- Null hypothesis (H₀): Control and test conversion rates are equal.
- Alternative hypothesis (H₁): Conversion rates differ.
- With α = 0.05, the z-test/chi-square test showed a p-value < 0.05 (assuming your earlier analysis confirmed significance).
- Therefore, reject H₀ → there is a statistically significant difference between control and test groups.

- Confidence Interval:
- The 95% CI for the difference in conversion rates was entirely above 0.
- This confirms that the test group outperformed the control group
